# TikTok-Claims-Classification
Machine learning project to classify TikTok user claims and opinions using logistic regression and classification models. Includes Jupyter notebook and executive summary.
# TikTok Claims Classification Project

This project focuses on building machine learning models to classify TikTok user-submitted content as **claims** or **opinions**. The analysis explores how account verification status and video features influence content type, and evaluates a logistic regression model as a baseline.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Explore the relationship between TikTok account verification and content type.  
2. Build a logistic regression model to predict **verified_status**.  
3. Evaluate the model and extract insights on feature importance.  
4. Prepare groundwork for the final classification model to predict **claims vs. opinions**.
